Occasionally the term "10X developer" keeps on surfacing in blogs and social media. Some of the writings are sarcastic, but it's not always the case. I became curious what is this "10X developer". To me it sounded like a unicorn developer who is 10 times more efficient, creative and productive than average developer. This kind of stuff normally is not invented out of thin air. There must be something else behind it. 

## Developers are artisans

Before we go any further with digging the story of "10X developer" I must say that it sounds ridiculous. Developers are artisans - not machines with multipliers. To me the term alianates the human in developer and turn him or her into a machine which has a certain machine type of capacity. It bit like a car engine has horse powers. Developers are creative people. Their creativeness is not artistic as it normally is understood. But great code is pleasant to read and looks "nice". It has artistic features. Every bigger code block is unique and thus are representations of the creators mind and desires. 

> Developers are the artists of the digital economy. 

## Developers have different skills

Not all developers are ninja-guru-fullstack-unicorns which produce 3000 lines of super efficient code every hour. That would be a machine and machines are standardised engines. Developers at least for now are humans. We have different skills. Skills are acquired by training, using the tools and exploring the opportunities. To me most talented developers are labelled as hackers. They find unusual usage to tools and services as well as hardware. They are the explorers of the digital economy/realm. 

AI probably will be able to create beautiful code in the future, code which is hard to differentiate from human production, but we are not there yet. AI and even simpler tools like code generators can assist the developer with boring stuff, but the creative part still requires human touch. It requires an artisan. 

## But what is the origin of 10X developer myth?
