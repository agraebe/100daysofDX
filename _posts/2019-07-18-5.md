Occasionally the term "10x developer" keeps on surfacing in blogs and social media. Some of the writings are sarcastic, but it's not always the case. I became curious what is this "10x developer". To me it sounded like a unicorn developer who is 10 times more efficient, creative and productive than average developer. This kind of stuff normally is not invented out of thin air. There must be something else behind it. 

Before we go any further with digging the story of "10x developer" I must say that it sounds ridiculous. Developers are artisans - not machines with multipliers. To me the term alianates the human in developer and turn him or her into a machine which has a certain machine type of capacity. It bit like a car engine has horse powers. Developers are creative people. Their creativeness is not artistic as it normally is understood. But great code is pleasant to read and looks "nice". It has artistic features. Every bigger code block is unique and thus are representations of the creators mind and desires. Developers are artists of the digital economy.
