## Learning

## Testing

## Do things at scale. A simple CLI command can easily adjust configurations for a large group of systems at once.

## Something needs to be scripted and automated.

## You need greater control over system functions.

## Use NPM for Package Installs as Node Package Manager is easily the most popular tool for modern developers and it does not have a GUI.

## Utilize Git Version Control. 

Although Github does have decent GUI driven app as well. 

## For less memory usage.
