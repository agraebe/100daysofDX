On one Saturday evening I went to backyard with a cup of nice freshly brewed coffee to enjoy life and good weather (it was not raining in Tampere). Once again I started thinking about APIs and API Economy. I’m a visual person and thus I started to draw a picture of my thoughts. I came up with the below picture and tons of questions in my head. 

<img itemprop="image" src="/assets/img/day13/economy.png" alt="{{site.name}}">

Questions did not stop but kept on coming. More and more. One of the questions was 

1. “What is the role of open source in API economy? What will happen to open source once the APIs become more popular?" 
2. "Why the hell should I open source my API?” kept on spinning in my head and started to bother me. 

I love open source and I have learned 95% of my feeble skills from the open source community. APIs operated over http or other protocol (popular term is web-APIs) have become the default building blocks of services much like you would build a castle from lego blocks. The analogy is not perfect since with legos you don’t need glue at all, but with APIs you often need a little bit of own code (glue) to keep the castle in one piece. Nevertheless, more and more services are built by utilizing APIs built by 3rd parties. As a service developer you take the APIs in use (some commercial) to solve some problems in achieving your goal instead of developing the solution from scratch. That makes sense. I was scrathing an itch and I thought that some other people would have the same questions in head and needed answers. 

## APIs have become the default building blocks

As it was mentioned before, APIs operated over http or other protocol (popular term is web-APIs) have become the default building blocks of services much like you would build a castle from lego blocks. API solves are problem for someone else. It solves it well and is so easy to onboard that some even pay money for it. The same "scratch an itch" was and still is one of the ideas and driving forces of open source. Someone else has had the same itch to scratch and has decided to share the solution code with some permissive license. Similarities do not end there.

## With APIs you have no need to maintain code

With APIs you don’t maintain the code and same is with open source components. You don’t sell open source code. Instead you build services by stitching together pieces of open source code and sell the result to consumers. APIs are sold as services too. Both of them are monetised as services. Or course open source can be used in closed source apps which are then sold to public as software. Some of the open source licenses permit this but some dont’. But still the idea of scratching an itch is there in both. 

## Closed source code != everything is closed

Source code of APIs are quite commonly closed source nowadays. Does that mean all APIs are closed by nature? No it does not. As a consumer of the API, you are not consuming the API per se, but the logic behind it - value proposition. Thus having the API code most likely does not benefit anyone. Why so? Well, normally APIs are facades infront of the backend and the logic is in the backend, not in the API. Even the integration might be in between the API and backend and handles with yet another solution. **API is just a access point to value proposition**. 

They idea on an API is that the consumer does not need to care about what’s behind it and how it manages given tasks. It just does and that is what you pay for. **As a consumer I have no need to copy API anywhere. Why would open sourcing that benefit you are 3rd party API consumer?** It doesn’t and thus API code is not open source normally. 

Exceptions of course exists and public sector is one of those. They want to build API ones and replicate it to other places which are running the same backend. Events around one city area are stored in one (or multiple systems). Events for another city are in different systems. Now the two cities want to make developer’s life easier and provide same API for the events. Solution is that they add the same API on top of separate backend systems. They can do so with ease since it’s open source and shared in Github. Of course the logic is still in the backend and some minor adjustments might be needed, but the promise looks solid. Of course if they want to make developer’s life much more easier, they agree on the data models used too.  Otherwise they solve the API hell problem (multiple different APIs for same purpose), but create data model hell. Another case for open sourcing API is that if you contribute it to some existing open source solution, application, service, framework, SDK, library. 

## Open machine-readable spesifications

Significant amount of API providers (like Platform of Trust) have decided to share machine-readable specs of the open APIs for anyone to use. Most common format is OpenAPI spec which was previously known as swagger. Next to OpenAPI spec is still RAML and API Blueprint, but the tooling and buzz around those is fading since even the pushers of RAML have joined OpenAPI initiative under Linux Foundation. It seems evident that we are on the road towards OpenAPI spec monopoly regarding REST API specs.
