# Website for DX

![100 Days DX blog cover](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kyyberi/100daysofDX/gh-pages/assets/img/blog.png)

The site is a collection of developer experience posts - short posts. It is hosted as gh-pages and served via 100daysdx.com. The site might stay alive after 100 posts have been reached. If it proves to be valuable - I'll find a way to keep it alive. 

## Suggest topics 

You can suggest topics for me by raising an issue. I will not promise to write about your suggestion, but I promise to consider it thoroughly. 

[New idea for a post - raise an issue!](https://github.com/kyyberi/100daysofDX/issues/new)


## Contribute a post

To contribute a post, do the following:

### Create issue

- Add issue to issue list with label "Topic-idea"
- Wait until it has been approved (label "Approved" appears to it). In the comment you'll get the day number. The day number indicates when it will be published. You'll need the number in branching. See below. 

### Work on the content in branch

- Clone the repository
- Make a branch and follow naming pattern "feature/dayX" in which the "X" is the number of the post given to you in idea approval. See above. 
- Add your post to "_posts" folder and follow the naming pattern yyyy-mm-dd-X.md, in which the "X" is the number of the post given to you in idea approval. 
- Take a screenshot of the post header containing the header and description text, not the date. Make the picture 600px wide. 
- Pictures of the post are all added to /assest/img/ folder in which you should create a folder "dayX" in which the "X" is the number of the post given to you in idea approval. Just look at the previous posts and follow the lead. 

### Make a pull request 

- When you are done with the post, add "Ready" label to your issue. Then make a pull request. 

Since most of the posts are written by Jarkko Moilanen, but you should get the credit for it, you can add your details (name etc) in the beginning or the end. That way all know you've written it!
