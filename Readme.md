# Website for DX

![100 Days DX blog cover](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kyyberi/100daysofDX/gh-pages/assets/img/blog.png)

The site is a collection of developer experience posts - short posts. It is hosted as gh-pages and served via 100daysdx.com. The site might stay alive after 100 posts have been reached. If it proves to be valuable - I'll find a way to keep it alive. 

## Suggest topics 

You can suggest topics for me by raising an issue. I will not promise to write about your suggestion, but I promise to consider it thoroughly.
