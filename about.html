<h2>Why this site exists?</h2>

<p><b>The DX discussed here is mostly related to APIs and Platform Economy.</b></p>

<p>I've been writing a new book called <b>Build for Developers</b> for several months already. I had to build a habbit of writing 
at least something every day. First I tried to write one hour every day. That was overwhelming and I failed.</p>

<p>Now I write every day a short (around 500 words) post about Developer eXperience. All the content probably helps in writing the book as well.</p>

<p>Why 100 days? We'll I noticed a friend of mine doing 100 designs challenge or something like that. I thought to try same thing with DX and writing. At the same time, the 100 days acts as counter to book publishing. Aim is that after 100 days the book is ready.</p>
